Jakarta experiences a tropical monsoon climate as classified by the system. The city's wet season spans most of the year, from October to May. The dry season lasts from June to September,<br>
with each of these months receiving less than 100 millimetres (3.9 in) of rainfall on average. Situated in the western part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and February,<br>
averaging 299.7 millimetres (11.8 in) per month, while the driest month is August, with an average rainfall of 43.2 millimetres (1.7 in).

<br>
Every year faces recurring issues, such as floods and thunderstorms. A cyclonic vortex leads to moisture convergence over a large area, including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex<br>
causes a mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography<br>
in southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection that causes floods in Jakarta. 
<br>
<br>
Average temperatures are very high with moderate rainfall. During the day, the temperature usually hovers around 32 °C (89.6 °F) but drops to about 24 °C (75.2 °F) in the evening. These are average temperatures,<br>
and some days can be hotter. It's advisable to dress appropriately to handle the heat. January is the rainiest month, with over 300 millimetres (11.8 in) of precipitation, whereas August is the driest, with around 45<br>
millimetres (1.8 in) of rainfall. The average temperature in the coldest month (February) is 27 °C (80.6 °F), and in the warmest month (October), it is 28 °C (82.4 °F). Sea temperatures range from 26.5 °C (79.7 °F) in August to 29.5 °C<br>
(85.1 °F) in March, April, November, and December. Record low temperatures in Jakarta recorded 18.9 °C (66.0 °F), while the highest record reached 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).
